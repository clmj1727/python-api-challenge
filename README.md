## Summary
In this challenge, the goal is to use Python to analyze weather data and plan vacations. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, citipy library, and Geoapify API, the project explores how weather changes with latitude and uses this data to identify ideal vacation destinations.

## Overview

### WeatherPy
In **WeatherPy**, the objective is to:
1. **Retrieve weather data** for over 500 cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. **Create scatter plots** to demonstrate how weather variables like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed vary with latitude.
3. **Compute linear regression** for each weather variable to identify trends in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

### VacationPy
In **VacationPy**, the goal is to:
1. **Visualize cities** on a map, with city size representing humidity levels.
2. **Filter cities** based on ideal weather conditions, such as temperature, wind speed, and cloudiness.
3. **Identify hotels** near the selected cities using the Geoapify API and display them on the map.

This project provides hands-on experience with API usage, data visualization, and applying data analysis to real-world problems like vacation planning.
